 * system prompt with `houseStyle(mode)` instead of repeating anti-AI-tell rules.
 *
 * Rules are the documented "tells" that make text read as machine-generated
 * (em dashes, "not just X but Y", tricolon stacking, buzzwords, uniform rhythm).
 * Applies to GENERATED text only — never to extraction, which must faithfully
 * preserve the candidate's own words.

 * deterministic style gate (lib/tools/checks.ts) consume, so they can't drift.
 * Entries are matched case-insensitively at word boundaries; multi-word entries
 * are matched as phrases. "spearhead" covers inflections via prefix.
 * "orchestrat" is NOT here: it's legitimate AI terminology (agent/model
 * orchestration) but a tired power-verb in general use, so checks.ts flags it
 * context-sensitively (owner directive 2026-08-25) rather than banning outright.

- NEVER use "not just X, but Y" / "it's not about X, it's Y" / "isn't just ... it's".
- At most ONE rule-of-three list in a passage; no stacked parallel clauses.
- Vary sentence length. Mix short, punchy sentences with longer ones; never let three sentences in a row share the same shape or length.
- Plain words. BANNED: ${BANNED_WORDS.map((w) => (w.includes(" ") ? `"${w}"` : w)).join(", ")}.
- Cut superlatives and empty adverbs (extremely, incredibly, highly, deeply, truly, really).
- Be specific and concrete. Say the real thing rather than an abstraction.`;
